"""
Application of gravitational wave search for inspiral mergers based on the 
pycbc (py-thon c-ompact b-inary c-oalecence) package 

Single Detector minimal pipeline used as prototype to test pycbc architecture
to incorporate:

- CUDA GPU implementation of CBC SPA waveform generator and 
  matched filter by Alex Nitz (Univerity of Syracuse)

- Open Cl GPU implementation of full CBC pipeline by Benjamin Somhegyi and
  Gergely Debreczeni (KFKI, RMKI Budapest)

# best the kind of datavector and it's size to instanciate it. datavector will
# be destroyed when bank is destructed (by calling the swigged destructor) 
#
# cons: ?
#
# matched_filter.perform_generate_snr(stilde, htilde, snr)
# stilde and htilde are input buffers, snr is the outputbuffer
# snr has to be instantiated in the script context:
# snr = SnrResultTimeSeries(strain_data.segments_length)
# 
# pro: ?
#
# cons: matched_filter object has to check against the type of the given 
# datavector (as well as for stilde and htilde). More efford to document
# what is the input and what ist the output.
