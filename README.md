[PyCBC](http://pycbc.org) is a software package used to explore astrophysical sources of gravitational waves.
It contains algorithms to analyze gravitational-wave data,
detect coalescing compact binaries, and make bayesian inferences from gravitational-wave data.
PyCBC was used in the [first direct detection of gravitational waves](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102) and
is used in flagship analyses of LIGO and Virgo data.

PyCBC is collaboratively developed by the community and is lead by a team of GW astronomers with the
aim to build accessible tools for gravitational-wave data analysis.

The PyCBC home page is located on github at
