Welcome to PyCBC, a Python toolkit for analysis of data from gravitational-wave
laser interferometer detectors with the goal of detecting and studying signals
from compact binary coalescences (CBCs).

The PyCBC home page is located on github at

 * https://github.com/ligo-cbc/pycbc

Documentation is automatically built nightly and available from

 * http://ligo-cbc.github.io/pycbc/latest/html/

To download and install PyCBC follow the instructions at
