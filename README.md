Welcome to PyCBC, a Python toolkit for analysis of data from gravitational-wave
laser interferometer detectors with the goal of detecting and studying signals
from compact binary coalescences (CBCs).

The PyCBC home page is located on github at

 * https://github.com/ligo-cbc/pycbc

Documentation is automatically built nightly and available from

 * http://ligo-cbc.github.io/pycbc/latest/html/

To download and install PyCBC follow the instructions at

If you use any code from PyCBC in a scientific publication, then we ask that
it is cited in the following way:

```
These results were generating using the PyCBC software package
\cite{Canton:2014ena,Usman:2015kfa,pycbc-software}
```

For the citation ``pycbc-software``,  please use a bibtex entry and DOI for the
appropriate release of the PyCBC software (or the latest available release).
A bibtex key and DOI for each release is avaliable from [Zendo](http://zendo.org/).
A key for the latest release is available at:
