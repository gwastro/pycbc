"""
PLEASE FIX: This code is here because sphinx-apidoc does not have the
capability to exclude specific files from the documentation. The GPU modules
must be removed as we cannot import their stuff. This feature has been
requested in sphinx, remove this code and use it if it gets added.
We may need to write a patch for Sphinx to add this functionality.
