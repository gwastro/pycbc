PyCBC documentation
###################

PyCBC is a python toolkit for analysis of data from gravitational-wave laser interferometer detectors with the goal of detecting and studying signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs).

The goals of the PyCBC project are to:

- Provide tools for building gravitational-wave search workflows for CBCs
- Create a flexible, extensible production code for CBC analysis that can be released for the public
- Enable simple, easy and transparent access for various many-core architectures like GPUs

=======================================
Use of PyCBC in Scientific Publications
=======================================

If you use any code from PyCBC in a scientific publication, then we ask that
it is cited in the following way:

::

    These results were generating using the PyCBC software package
    \cite{Canton:2014ena,Usman:2015kfa,pycbc-software}

For the citation ``pycbc-software``,  please use a bibtex entry and DOI for the
appropriate release of the PyCBC software (or the latest available release).
A bibtex key and DOI for each release is avaliable from `Zendo <http://zendo.org/>`_.
A key for the latest release is available at:
