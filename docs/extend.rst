Extending PyCBC with external plugins
=====================================

Would you like to use a waveform model that PyCBC doesn't have? Or maybe
you have your own waveform you'd like to use for a search, parameter estimation
, etc. PyCBC supports a plug-in archictecture for external waveform models.
