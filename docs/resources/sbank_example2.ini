; What files to store? If this is set to "results" then only the final template
; bank will exist after the workflow completes.
; If set to "merged_triggers" then a template bank will be placed in the output
; directory after each "cycle" of the workflow generation completes.
; If set to "all_triggers" you will get some more files from within each cycle,
; but not the output of each of the parallel jobs.
; if set to "all_files" you will get everything.
file-retention-level = merged_triggers

; Start and end times are needed to obey LIGO file naming conventions. Actual
; values are irrelevant. This can be overriden on the command line.

; seed-bank can be used to provide an input to sbank jobs

; If using seed-bank, this will instruct sbank to use this to determine the
; initial chirp-mass bins. In this case a coarse job is not run

[pegasus_profile-sbank-coarse]
; These are pegasus specific options for sbank jobs with the coarse tag.
; One main example of this section is to specify options to go into the 
; submit file. For example:

condor|request_memory = 10000
; This can take a lot of RAM! Other options for condor sub files can be
; specified in the same way. Things like accounting group are automatically
; added, as is get_env = True.
