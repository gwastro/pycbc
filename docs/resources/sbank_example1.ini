; What files to store? If this is set to "results" then only the final template
; bank will exist after the workflow completes.
; If set to "merged_triggers" then a template bank will be placed in the output
; directory after each "cycle" of the workflow generation completes.
; If set to "all_triggers" you will get some more files from within each cycle,
; but not the output of each of the parallel jobs.
; if set to "all_files" you will get everything.

; Start and end times are needed to obey LIGO file naming conventions. Actual
; values are irrelevant. This can be overriden on the command line.
