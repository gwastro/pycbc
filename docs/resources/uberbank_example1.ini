; nbanks is how many parallel jobs to use, setting this large no longer causes
; overcoverage *but* be careful that the templates generated by all nbanks is
; not that large that it causes memory issues when readding. You can limit the
; number of templates added by each job and then run more total cycles. For
; weird parameter space (e.g. precession) set number of cycles to a large
; value, use a good number of nbanks, but accept only 10-100 templates per job
; This let's the bank slowly converge while you can monitor the periodic
; output!
