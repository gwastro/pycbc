Installing lalsuite for PyCBC
##############################################

The following page describes how to build lalsuite from source for use with PyCBC. 

.. note::

    These instructions assume that you already have the required dependencies for lalsuite installed on your system. You must have ``git``, ``FFTW``, ``GSL``, ``FrameL``, and ``MetaIO`` installed before continuing. 
    
    These packages are installed by default on a LIGO Data Grid cluster. If you are not on a LIGO Data Grid cluster, then you can download them from the `lscsoft repository <https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/download/repositories.html>`_ or see the `lscsoft install instructions <https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/docs/howto/lscsoft-install.html>`_ for instructions on building the dependencies from source. You can also contact your system administrator to determine if these packages are available using the ``module load`` command.

====================================================
Obtaining the source code and checking out a version
====================================================

Clone the lalsuite repository by following the `instructions on the DASWG pages <https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/docs/howto/advanced-lalsuite-git.html#clone>`_. 

.. note::

    Since building lalsuite is very disk intensive, you may want to store the lalsuite git repository on a local disk rather than an NSF-mounted directory. 

Once you have the repository cloned, you should change your working directory to the top-level of the repository with 

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /path/to/your/lalsuite

Now determine which version of the code you want to install. To run the latest (possibly unstable) version of the code, use the ``master`` branch by running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout master

If you want to build a specific release, replace ``master`` with a release tag, for example ``lalsuite-v6.30``. See the `list of lalsuite tags <https://ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/cgit/lalsuite/refs/tags>`_ for available tags. You can also check out a branch from the `list of lalsuite branches <https://ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/cgit/lalsuite/refs/heads>`_ in the same way; replace ``master`` with the branch name, e.g. ``lalsuite_o1_branch``.  Once you have checked out a tag or a branch, you can build and install lalsuite.


=====================================================
Building and installing into your virtual environment
=====================================================

.. note::

    The install instructions below install lalsuite into a directory called ``opt/lalsuite`` under your virtual environment. You can remove lalsuite by removing this directory with ``rm -rf $NAME/opt/lalsuite``. If you want to install multiple versions of lalsuite in your virtual environment, you can chose different directories by specifying a different ``--prefix`` to configure below.

Set the shell variable ``NAME`` to the path to your the virtual environment that you created for PyCBC and activate your environment, for example

.. code-block:: bash

    NAME=${HOME}/pycbc-dev
    source $NAME/bin/activate

From the top-level lalsuite directory, you can use the master configure script to build and install all of the components that you need with the commands 

.. code-block:: bash

    ./00boot 
    ./configure --prefix=$NAME/opt/lalsuite --enable-swig-python --disable-lalstochastic --disable-lalxml --disable-lalinference --disable-laldetchar
    make
    make install

The install process creates a shell script called ``lalsuite-user-env.sh`` that sources all of the ``$NAME/opt/lalsuite/etc/lal*-user-env.sh`` scripts that set up the environment for lalsuite. You can add this to your virtualenv ``activate`` script so that it gets set up when you enter your virtual environment. To do this, run the commands

.. code-block:: bash

    echo 'source ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/opt/lalsuite/etc/lalsuite-user-env.sh' >> $NAME/bin/activate
    deactivate
    source $NAME/bin/activate

.. note::

    If you want to manage multiple versions of lalsuite, it is not reccommended to source the ``lalsuite-user-env.sh`` script from your activate script.  You should just source it when you enter your virtual environment with the command ``source ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/opt/lalsuite/etc/lalsuite-user-env.sh``

lalsuite is now installed in your virtual environment. You can check this with the command

.. code-block:: bash

    echo $LAL_PREFIX

which should return the path to the installation under your virtual environment.
