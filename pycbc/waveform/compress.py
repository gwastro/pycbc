    An estimate of the waveform duration starting from flow. This is intended
    to be fast but not necessarily accurate. It should be an overestimate of
    the length. It is derived from a simplification of the 0PN post-newtonian
    terms and includes a fudge factor for possible ringdown, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m1: float
        mass of first component object in solar masses
    m2: float
        mass of second component object in solar masses
    flow: float

        value
    fudge_min: optional, {0.2, float}
        Minimum signal duration that can be returned. This should be long
        enough to encompass the ringdown and errors in the precise end time.

        The precision used to generate the compressed waveform's amplitude and

    load_to_memory : bool
        Whether or not to load `sample_points`/`amplitude`/`phase` into memory

        set directly to toggle this behavior.
    interpolation : str
        The interpolation that was used when compressing the waveform, for
        checking the mismatch. Also the default interpolation used when
        decompressing.
    tolerance : {None, float}
        The tolerance that was used when compressing the waveform.
    mismatch : {None, float}
        The mismatch between the decompressed waveform and the original
        waveform.
    precision : {'double', str}
        The precision used to generate and store the compressed waveform
        points. Options are 'double' or 'single'; default is 'double
