This module contains functions to filter injections with only useful templates.

This module implements a set of checks to test for each segment and template
combination whether injections contained within the segment are sufficiently
"similar" to the template to require a matched-filter. There are a few ways of
testing the "similarity" of templates and injections.

* A chirp time threshold rejects templates if chirp time difference is large
* A coarse match threshold rejects templates if a coarse overlap is small
