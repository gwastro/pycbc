    ----------

    Parameters
    ----------
    likelihood_evaluator : likelihood class
        An instance of the likelihood class from the
        pycbc.inference.likelihood module.
    nwalkers : int
        Number of walkers to use in MCMC.
    ndim : int

    transd : bool

        kombine.clustered_kde.TransdimensionalKDE proposal distribution. In
        this mode a masked array with samples in each of the possible sets of
        dimensions must be given for the initial ensemble distribution.
    processes : {None, int}
        Number of processes to use with multiprocessing. If None, all available
        cores are used.
