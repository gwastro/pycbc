class HierarchicalModel(BaseModel):
    r"""Model that is a combination of other models.

    Sub-models are treated as being independent of each other, although
    they can share parameters. In other words, the hiearchical likelihood is:

    .. math::

        p(\mathbf{D}|\mathbf{\vartheta}, \mathbf{H}) =
            \prod_{I}^{K} p(\mathbf{d}_I|\mathbf{\vartheta}, H_{I})

    Submodels are provided as a dictionary upon initialization with a unique
    label assigned to each model, e.g., ``{'event1' -> model1, 'event2' ->
    model2}``. Variable and static parameters that are specific to each
    submodel should be prepended with ``{label}__``, where ``{label}__`` is the
    label associated with the given submodel. Shared parameters across multiple
    models have no labels prepended. To specify shared models over a subset of
    models, separate models with an underscore.  For example,
    ``event1_event2__foo`` will result in ``foo`` being common between models
    ``event1`` and ``event2``. For more details on parameter naming see
    :py:class:`HierarchicalParam
    <pycbc.inference.models.hierarchical.HierarchicalParam>`.

    All waveform and sampling transforms, as well as prior evaluation, are
    handled by this model, not the sub-models. Parameters created by waveform
    transforms should therefore also have sub-model names prepended to them,
    to indicate which models they should be provided to for likelihood
    evaluation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    variable_params: (tuple of) string(s)
        A tuple of parameter names that will be varied.
    submodels: dict
        Dictionary of model labels -> model instances of all the submodels.
    \**kwargs :
        All other keyword arguments are passed to
        :py:class:`BaseModel <pycbc.inference.models.base.BaseModel>`.

        r"""Initializes an instance of this class from the given config file.

        Sub-models are initialized before initializing this class. The model
        section must have a ``submodels`` argument that lists the names of all
        the submodels to generate as a space-separated list. Each sub-model
        should have its own ``[{label}__model]`` section that sets up the
        model for that sub-model. For example:

        .. code-block:: ini

            [model]
            name = hiearchical
            submodels = event1 event2

            [event1__model]
            <event1 model options>

            [event2__model]
            <event2 model options>

        Similarly, all other sections that are specific to a model should start
        with the model's label. All sections starting with a model's label will
        be passed to that model's ``from_config`` method with the label removed
        from the section name. For example, if a sub-model requires a data
        section to be specified, it should be titled ``[{label}__data]``. Upon
        initialization, the ``{label}__`` will be stripped from the section
        header and passed to the model.

        No model labels should preceed the ``variable_params``,
        ``static_params``, ``waveform_transforms``, or ``sampling_transforms``
        sections.  Instead, the parameters specified in these sections should
        follow the naming conventions described in :py:class:`HierachicalParam`
        to determine which sub-model(s) they belong to. (Sampling parameters
        can follow any naming convention, as they are only handled by the
        hierarchical model.) This is because the hierarchical model handles
        all transforms, communication with the sampler, file IO, and prior
        calculation. Only sub-model's loglikelihood functions are called.

        Metadata for each sub-model is written to the output hdf file under
        groups given by the sub-model label. For example, if we have two
        submodels labelled ``event1`` and ``event2``, there will be groups
        with the same names in the top level of the output that contain that
        model's subdata. For instance, if event1 used the ``gaussian_noise``
        model, the GW data and PSDs will be found in ``event1/data`` and the
        low frequency cutoff used for that model will be in the ``attrs`` of
        the ``event1`` group.

class HierarchicalParam(str):
    """Sub-class of str for hierarchical parameter names.

    This adds attributes that keep track of the model label(s) the parameter
    is associated with, along with the name that is passed to the models.

    The following conventions are used for parsing parameter names:

      * Model labels and parameter names are separated by the ``delim`` class
        attribute, which by default is ``__``, e.g., ``event1__mass``.
      * Multiple model labels can be provided by separating the model labels
        with the ``model_delim`` class attribute, which by default is ``_``,
        e.g., ``event1_event2__mass``. Note that this means that individual
        model labels cannot contain ``_``, else they'll be parsed as separate
        models.
      * Parameters that have no model labels prepended to them (i.e., there
        is no ``__`` in the name) are common to all models.

    These parsing rules are applied by the :py:meth:`HierarchicalParam.parse`
    method.
