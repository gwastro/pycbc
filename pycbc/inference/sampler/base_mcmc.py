    along with ``BaseSampler``.

    This class provides ``set_initial_conditions``, ``run``, and ``checkpoint``
    methods, which are some of the abstract methods required by
    ``BaseSampler``.

    This class introduces the following abstract properties and methods:

    * base_shape
        [`property`] Should give the shape of the samples arrays used by the
        sampler, excluding the iteraitons dimension. Needed for writing
        results.
    * run_mcmc(niterations)
        Should run the sampler for the given number of iterations. Called by
        ``run``.
    * clear_samples()
        Should clear samples from memory. Called by ``run``.
    * set_state_from_file(filename)
        Should set the random state of the sampler using the given filename.
        Called by ``set_initial_conditions``.
    * write_results(filename)
        Writes results to the given filename. Called by ``checkpoint``.
    * compute_acf(filename, \**kwargs)
        [`classmethod`] Should compute the autocorrelation function using
        the given filename. Also allows for other keyword arguments.
    * compute_acl(filename, \**kwargs)
        [`classmethod`] Should compute the autocorrelation length using
        the given filename. Also allows for other keyword arguments.
