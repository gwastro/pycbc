        Number of "taps", i.e. FIR filter coefficients. A higher value
        leads to a more precise approximation of the desired filter.

    """ Create a time series of pure noise with time dependent noise spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psd_fn : callable
        Function which provides the time varying PSD. Must accept a call
        signature of `psd_fn(freqs, tau)`, where `freqs` is a numpy array
        of frequencies in [Hz], and `tau` is the normalised time, i.e.
        `current_time / duration`. Must return a numpy array of the same
        shape as `freqs`.
    sample_rate : float
        Sample rate of the generate time series in units of [sec]. Required
        as the filter design depends on the Nyquist frequency.
    duration : float
        Duration of the resulting time series in [sec].
    psd_resolution : int
        Number of points for which the psd_fn in evaluated before being
        passed to the filter generation. Using a large number should be
        generally harmless and without side effects. Recommended to be
        a few time the filter resolution `n_taps`.
    n_taps : int
        Number of coefficients used in the FIR filter, i.e. length of the
        filter in samples.
    time_resolution : int
        The FIR filter is recomputed every `time_resolution` samples to
        smoothly vary the noise PSD over the length of the time series.
        This directly impacts performance as filter application is much
        cheaper than the recomputing of filter coefficients.
        If the value is larger than the number of samples, a warning is
        issued if `quiet` is not set to `True`.
    use_time_directly : bool
        If `True`, the `tau` parameter in `psd_fn(freq, tau)` will be
        passed as the true time within the generated time series.
        The default is False.
    seed : int, optional
        Seed used to initialise the numpy random number generator.
        The default is 0.
    quiet : bool, optional
        If `True`, warnings will be supressed. The default is False.
    skip_checks : bool, optional
        If `True`, some internal consistency checks will be skipped for
        the sake of slightly better performance.
    progress : bool, optional
        If `True`, display a simple progress counter. The default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    times, noisy_time_series : pair of (duration*sample_rate,) arrays
        Time stamps and time series of pure noise with variable
        noise properties.

    Notes
    -----
    Currently, the overall noise level may be off by a constant factor.
    Check this and remove the warning before serious use.
