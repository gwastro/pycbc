    '''
    Setup gating section of CBC workflow. At present this only supports pregenerated
    gating files, in the future these could be created within the workflow.

    Parameters
    ----------
    workflow: pycbc.workflow.core.Workflow
        An instanced class that manages the constructed workflow.
    science_segs : Keyed dictionary of glue.segmentlist objects
        scienceSegs[ifo] holds the science segments to be analysed for each
        ifo. 
    datafind_outs : pycbc.workflow.core.FileList
        The file list containing the datafind files.
    output_dir : path string
        The directory where data products will be placed. 
    tags : list of strings
        If given these tags are used to uniquely name and identify output files
        that would be produced in multiple calls to this function.

    Returns
    --------
    gate_files : pycbc.workflow.core.FileList
        The FileList holding the gate files, 0 or 1 per ifo
