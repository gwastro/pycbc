    Setup gating section of CBC workflow. At present this only supports pregenerated

    Parameters
    ----------
    workflow: pycbc.workflow.core.Workflow
        An instanced class that manages the constructed workflow.
    output_dir : path string
        The directory where data products will be placed.

    Returns

        The FileList holding the gate files, 0 or 1 per ifo
