    This function aims to be the gateway for setting up a set of matched-filter
    jobs in a workflow. This function is intended to support multiple
    different ways/codes that could be used for doing this. For now the only
    supported sub-module is one that runs the matched-filtering by setting up
    a serious of matched-filtering jobs, from one executable, to create
    matched-filter triggers covering the full range of science times for which
    there is data and a template bank file.

    Parameters
    -----------
    Workflow : pycbc.workflow.core.Workflow
        The workflow instance that the coincidence jobs will be added to.
    science_segs : ifo-keyed dictionary of glue.segments.segmentlist instances
        The list of times that are being analysed in this workflow. 
    datafind_outs : pycbc.workflow.core.FileList
        An FileList of the datafind files that are needed to obtain the
        data used in the analysis.
    tmplt_banks : pycbc.workflow.core.FileList
        An FileList of the template bank files that will serve as input
        in this stage.
    output_dir : path
        The directory in which output will be stored.
    injection_file : pycbc.workflow.core.File, optional (default=None)
        If given the file containing the simulation file to be sent to these
        jobs on the command line. If not given no file will be sent.
    tags : list of strings (optional, default = [])
        A list of the tagging strings that will be used for all jobs created
        by this call to the workflow. An example might be ['BNSINJECTIONS'] or
        ['NOINJECTIONANALYSIS']. This will be used in output names.
        
    Returns
    -------
    inspiral_outs : pycbc.workflow.core.FileList
        A list of output files written by this stage. This *will not* contain
        any intermediate products produced within this stage of the workflow.
        If you require access to any intermediate products produced at this
        stage you can call the various sub-functions directly.

    Parameters
    -----------
    workflow : pycbc.workflow.core.Workflow
        The Workflow instance that the coincidence jobs will be added to.
    science_segs : ifo-keyed dictionary of glue.segments.segmentlist instances
        The list of times that are being analysed in this workflow. 
    datafind_outs : pycbc.workflow.core.FileList
        An FileList of the datafind files that are needed to obtain the
        data used in the analysis.
    tmplt_banks : pycbc.workflow.core.FileList
        An FileList of the template bank files that will serve as input
        in this stage.
    output_dir : path
        The directory in which output will be stored.
    injection_file : pycbc.workflow.core.File, optional (default=None)
        If given the file containing the simulation file to be sent to these
        jobs on the command line. If not given no file will be sent.
    tags : list of strings (optional, default = [])
        A list of the tagging strings that will be used for all jobs created
        by this call to the workflow. An example might be ['BNSINJECTIONS'] or
        ['NOINJECTIONANALYSIS']. This will be used in output names.
    link_to_tmpltbank : boolean, optional (default=True)
        If this option is given, the job valid_times will be altered so that there
        will be one inspiral file for every template bank and they will cover the
        same time span. Note that this option must also be given during template
        bank generation to be meaningful.
