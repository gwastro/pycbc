def filter_zpk(timeseries, z, p, k):
    """Return a new timeseries that was filtered with a zero-pole-gain filter.

    The transfer function in the s-domain looks like:
    H(s) = (s - s_1) * (s - s_3) * ... * (s - s_n)  , m >= n
           ---------------------------------------
           (s - s_2) * (s - s_4) * ... * (s - s_m)

    The zeroes, and poles entered in Hz are converted to angular frequency,
    along the imaginary axis in the s-domain s=i*omega.

    Then the zeroes, and poles are bilinearly transformed via:
    z(s) = (1 + s*T/2)
           -----------
           (1 - s*T/2)

    Where z is the z-domain value, s is the s-domain value, and T is the
    sampling period.

    After the poles and zeroes have been bilinearly transformed, then
    the second-order sections are found and filter the data using scipy. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeseries: TimeSeries
        The TimeSeries instance to be filtered.
    z: array
        Array of zeros to include in zero-pole-gain filter design.
        In units of Hz.
    p: array
        Array of poles to include in zero-pole-gain filter design.
        In units of Hz.
    k: float
        Gain to include in zero-pole-gain filter design. This gain is a
        constant multiplied to the transfer function.

    Returns
    -------
    Time Series: TimeSeries
        A  new TimeSeries that has been filtered. 

    Examples
    --------
    To apply a 5 zeroes at 100Hz, 5 poles at 1Hz, and a gain of 1e-10 filter
    to a TimeSeries instance, do:
    >>> filtered_data = zpk_filter(timeseries, [100]*5, [1]*5, 1e-10)
