    """ Calculates the autocorrelation function (ACF) and returns the one-sided
    ACF.

    ACF is estimated using

    Where \hat{R}(k) is the ACF, X_{t} is the data series at time t, \mu is the
    mean of X_{t}, and \sigma^{2} is the variance of X_{t}.

    Parameters
    -----------
    data : {TimeSeries, numpy.array}
        A TimeSeries or numpy.array of data.

    Returns
    -------
    acf : numpy.array
        If data is a TimeSeries then acf will be a TimeSeries of the
        one-sided ACF. Else acf is a numpy.array.

    Where r is the ACL and \hat{R}(k) is the ACF.

    The parameter k sets the maximum samples to use in calculation of ACL.

    The parameter m controls the length of the window that is summed to
    compute the ACL.

    Parameters
    -----------
    data : {TimeSeries, numpy.array}
        A TimeSeries or numpy.array of data.
    dtype : {int, float}
        The datatype of the output.

    Returns
    -------
    acl : {int, float}
        The ACL. If ACL can not be estimated then returns numpy.inf. If data
        was a TimeSeries then the ACL will be the number of samples times the
        delta_t attribute.
