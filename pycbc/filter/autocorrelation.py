def calculate_acf(data, delta_t=1.0, unbiased=False):
    r"""Calculates the one-sided autocorrelation function.

    Calculates the autocorrelation function (ACF) and returns the one-sided
    ACF. The ACF is defined as the autocovariance divided by the variance. The
    ACF can be estimated using

    .. math::

        \hat{R}(k) = \frac{1}{n \sigma^{2}} \sum_{t=1}^{n-k} \left( X_{t} - \mu \right) \left( X_{t+k} - \mu \right)

    Where :math:`\hat{R}(k)` is the ACF, :math:`X_{t}` is the data series at
    time t, :math:`\mu` is the mean of :math:`X_{t}`, and :math:`\sigma^{2}` is
    the variance of :math:`X_{t}`.

    Parameters
    -----------
    data : TimeSeries or numpy.array
        A TimeSeries or numpy.array of data.
    delta_t : float
        The time step of the data series if it is not a TimeSeries instance.
    unbiased : bool
        If True the normalization of the autocovariance function is n-k
        instead of n. This is called the unbiased estimation of the
        autocovariance. Note that this does not mean the ACF is unbiased.

    Returns
    -------
    acf : numpy.array
        If data is a TimeSeries then acf will be a TimeSeries of the
        one-sided ACF. Else acf is a numpy.array.

def calculate_acl(data, m=5, dtype=int):
    r"""Calculates the autocorrelation length (ACL).

    Given a normalized autocorrelation function :math:`\rho[i]` (by normalized,
    we mean that :math:`\rho[0] = 1`), the ACL :math:`\tau` is:

    .. math::

        \tau = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=1}^{K} \rho[i].

    The number of samples used :math:`K` is found by using the first point
    such that:

    .. math::

        m \tau[K] \leq K,

    where :math:`m` is a tuneable parameter (default = 5). If no such point
    exists, then the given data set it too short to estimate the ACL; in this
    case ``inf`` is returned.

    This algorithm for computing the ACL is taken from:

    N. Madras and A.D. Sokal, J. Stat. Phys. 50, 109 (1988).

    Parameters
    -----------
    data : TimeSeries or array
        A TimeSeries of data.
    m : int
        The number of autocorrelation lengths to use for determining the window
        size :math:`K` (see above).
    dtype : int or float
        The datatype of the output. If the dtype was set to int, then the
        ceiling is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    acl : int or float
        The autocorrelation length. If the ACL cannot be estimated, returns
        ``numpy.inf``.
