    Parameters
    -----------
    data : {TimeSeries, numpy.array}
        A TimeSeries or numpy.array of data.
    delta_t : float
        The time step of the data series if it is not a TimeSeries instance.

    The parameter k sets the maximum samples to use in calculation of ACL.

    The parameter m controls the length of the window that is summed to

    Parameters
    -----------
    data : {TimeSeries, numpy.array}

        The ACL. If ACL can not be estimated then returns numpy.inf. If data
