; this will cause the data to be resampled to 2048 Hz:
sample-rate = 2048
; We'll use a high-pass filter so as not to get numerical errors from the large
; amplitude low frequency noise. Here we use 15 Hz, which is safely below the
; low frequency cutoff of our likelihood integral (20 Hz)
strain-high-pass = 15
; The pad-data argument is for the high-pass filter: 8s are added to the
; beginning/end of the analysis/psd times when the data is loaded. After the
; high pass filter is applied, the additional time is discarded. This pad is
; *in addition to* the time added to the analysis start/end time for the PSD
; inverse length. Since it is discarded before the data is transformed for the
; likelihood integral, it has little affect on the run time.
