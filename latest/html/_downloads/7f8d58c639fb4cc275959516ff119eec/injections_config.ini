; As with events sections in the standard workflow, you can specify
; config-overrides for the above file(s). Here, we will change the prior from
; uniform in comoving volume to uniform in the log10 of the comoving volume.
; We'll do this so as to get a distribution of injections with appreciable
; SNR. (A uniform in comoving volume prior leads to most of the injections
; having SNR < 7, and so we mostly end up seeing prior-in, prior-out.)
config-overrides = prior-comoving_volume:name:uniform_log10
; Optionally, you may also specify the number of times to run inference on
; each injection by setting nruns. Each run will use different random seeds,
; and samples from the runs will be combined into a single posterior file for
; each injection. Not setting this is equivalent to nruns = 1
;nruns = 1

; For the injection workflow, we need to add an executable to create the
; injections. Optionally, we may also add executables to perform
; percentile-percentile (pp) tests.
[executables]
create_injections = ${which:pycbc_create_injections}
; Executables for percentile-percentile test. These are optional. If you do
; not include them in this section, no PP test will be done. If you do
; include them, all 3 must be included.
pp_table_summary = ${which:pycbc_inference_pp_table_summary}
plot_pp = ${which:pycbc_inference_plot_pp}
inj_recovery = ${which:pycbc_inference_plot_inj_recovery}
; We do not need to provide any of the other executables since they are
; specified in workflow_config.ini. When this file is combined with
; workflow_config.ini, these options are automatically added to the
; [executables] section in that file.


[workflow-pp_test]
; Since we have included the executables to make the PP plots, we need to
; provide this section.
; The pp-params option specifies what parameters to perform the percentile-
; percentile test on. If you do not provide anything, all parameters
; in the posterior file will be used (that is set by the parameters
; argument in the [extract_posterior] section in workflow_config.ini). A
; p-value of p-values will be calculated for all parameters and reported
; in the summary table on the Percentile-Percentile table of the results
; page. We therefore do not want to include all parameters in the posterior
; file, since we have added parameters that are derived from the others in
; [extract_posterior] section. For this reason, we manually list all the
; parameters we want to do the pp test on here:
pp-params = delta_tc srcmass1 srcmass2 spin1_a spin1_azimuthal spin1_polar
            spin2_a spin2_azimuthal spin2_polar distance inclination
            polarization ra dec
; In order to do the PP test, the code needs to know what parameters in the
; posterior correspond to which injection parameters. Since we have applied
; some functions to the samples parameters when creating the posterior file
; (again, refer to the [extract_posterior] section in workflow_config.ini),
; the mapping between posterior parameters and injection parameters is no
; longer a 1:1. To tell the code how to map from the injections parameters
; the posterior parameters, we provide the following injection-samples-map.
; We can just copy most of the parameters argument from the [extract_posterior]
; section for this (we can't just do a reference because the wildcard (*) that
; is there is not understood by the injection-samples-map option.

; Notice that we can provide more parameters to the injection-samples-map then
