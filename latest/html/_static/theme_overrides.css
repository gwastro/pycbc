/* Override table width restrictions:
   The RTD theme causes tables rows to all be single line, even if the row
   spans multiple lines in the rst formatting. This overrides that, causing
   RTD to use the text wrapping specified in the RST. For more details, see
   https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/117 */
