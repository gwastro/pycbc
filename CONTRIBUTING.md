# Inroduction

### Welcome!

First of all, thank you for contributing to PyCBC! PyCBC is open source and
community developed, so welcome to that community!

Following these guidelines help review your contribution 
and will speed up the process of adding it to the repository.

We welcome improvements to library functionality, fixing bugs, adding
additional useful scripts, documentation, and also tutorials.

# Ground Rules
As with life, try to be respectful and patient!

# Make a contribution

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: https://gist.github.com/audreyr/4feef90445b9680475f2
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
